# Senior Engineering Explanation: `src/app/favicon.ico`

## Ownership and Intent
This file contributes to global app composition, including layout, metadata, and cross-page shell concerns.

## Code-Level Applicability
This artifact is binary/static and does not contain executable code-level constructs such as function composition, state transitions, lexical scope layering, or runtime control flow.

## Why This Still Matters
- Asset stability preserves predictable references from the UI/application layer.
- Deterministic file contents improve cache behavior and deployment reproducibility.
- Changes should be intentional because visual assets can influence user trust and perceived quality.
