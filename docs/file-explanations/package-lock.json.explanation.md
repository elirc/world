# Senior Engineering Explanation: `package-lock.json`

## Ownership and Intent
This lockfile pins transitive dependencies to exact versions. Its role is deterministic build reproducibility and supply-chain consistency across developer and CI environments.

## How the Implementation Works
The implementation follows a clear separation of concerns and keeps responsibilities explicit.

Detected exports / entry points:
None detected in this file.

## Why It Is Implemented This Way
Design choices in this file favor maintainability over short-term convenience. The code is structured so that behavior changes can be made in one layer without causing cascading edits across unrelated modules.

## Operational and Maintenance Considerations
This file currently has approximately 7465 lines, which is manageable but should still be monitored for responsibility creep.

Operationally, future changes should preserve backward-compatible behavior at public interfaces (routes, exported service functions, and schema contracts).

Treat lockfile diffs as supply-chain surface area changes. Large lockfile churn should be reviewed with the same seriousness as application code changes.

## Safe Extension Guidance
- 1. Add or change behavior in the owning layer only; avoid bypassing abstractions for convenience.
- 2. Keep input/output contracts explicit and update validators/types/route expectations together.
- 3. Preserve auditability for mutating workflows; if data changes materially, record who/when/what changed.
- 4. Add regression coverage (or at minimum reproducible manual verification steps) for critical workflow paths.
